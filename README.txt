Demo:
    Extract these split-volume compressed folders by WinRAR and you will obtain 
5 program files. The 5 programs are respectively named to correspond to 
the extraction of different order physical structure parameters. The detailed 
process can be found in Figure 4 and the corresponding text explanations in 
the manuscript.

Instructions for use:
    1. Program 4×4: In sequence by columns, the charge parameters of 
16 grids were changed and simulation calculations are performed. 
Each time, 16 X electric field parameters and 16 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. After 16 rounds of sampling cycles, 
a total of 256 X electric field parameters and 256 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. Their matrix forms are presented in Figure S7.
    2. Program 8×8: In sequence by columns, the charge parameters of 
64 grids were changed and simulation calculations are performed. 
Each time, 64 X electric field parameters and 64 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. After 64 rounds of sampling cycles, 
a total of 4096 X electric field parameters and 4096 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. Their matrix forms are presented in Figure S8.
    3. Program 16×16: In sequence by columns, the charge parameters of 
256 grids were changed and simulation calculations are performed. 
Each time, 256 X electric field parameters and 256 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. After 256 rounds of sampling cycles, 
a total of 65536 X electric field parameters and 65536 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. Their matrix forms are presented in Figures S9 and S10.
    4. Program 32×32: In sequence by columns, the charge parameters of 
1024 grids were changed and simulation calculations are performed. 
Each time, 1024 X electric field parameters and 1024 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. After 1024 rounds of sampling cycles, 
a total of 1048576 X electric field parameters and 1048576 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. Their matrix forms are presented in Figures S11 and S12.
    5. Program 64×64: In sequence by columns, the charge parameters of 
4096 grids were changed and simulation calculations are performed. 
Each time, 4096 X electric field parameters and 4096 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. After 4096 rounds of sampling cycles, 
a total of 16777216 X electric field parameters and 16777216 Y electric field 
parameters are obtained. Their matrix forms are presented in Figures S13 and S14.
